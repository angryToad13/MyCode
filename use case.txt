📌 Smart Task & Project Management System

Technology Stack:
	•	Frontend: Angular
	•	Backend: Java Spring Boot
	•	Database: H2 / MySQL
	•	Optional: Liquibase

⸻

🎯 Objective

Build a web application to manage projects and tasks with role-based access.
Users can create tasks, assign them, and track progress, while Admin manages projects and approvals.

This assignment covers:
	•	Role-based access
	•	CRUD operations
	•	Business logic
	•	Angular forms & routing
	•	Spring Boot REST APIs
	•	Database relationships

⸻

👥 Roles

1️⃣ ADMIN
	•	Create / Update / Delete Projects
	•	View all tasks
	•	Approve or Reject tasks
	•	Manage users (optional)

2️⃣ USER
	•	View assigned projects
	•	Create tasks
	•	Update task status
	•	View own tasks

⸻

🧩 Functional Requirements

⸻

1️⃣ Login Module

Create a Login Page with fields:
	•	Role (ADMIN / USER)
	•	Username
	•	Password

✅ After login:
	•	Redirect to dashboard
	•	Show menu based on role

⸻

2️⃣ Dashboard & Menu (Role-Based)

If Role = USER
Menu should show:
	•	My Projects
	•	My Tasks
	•	Create Task

If Role = ADMIN
Menu should show:
	•	Projects
	•	All Tasks
	•	Task Approval

⸻

3️⃣ Project Management Module (Admin Only)

Features:
	•	Create Project
	•	View Project List
	•	Update Project
	•	Delete Project

Project Fields:
	•	Project ID (auto-generated)
	•	Project Name
	•	Description
	•	Start Date
	•	End Date
	•	Status (ACTIVE / COMPLETED)

✅ Validations:
	•	Project name required
	•	End date must be after start date

⸻

4️⃣ Task Management Module

Features:
	•	Create Task (User)
	•	View Task List
	•	Update Task
	•	Delete Task (Admin only)

Task Fields:
	•	Task ID
	•	Task Title
	•	Description
	•	Priority (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH)
	•	Status (NEW / IN_PROGRESS / COMPLETED / APPROVED / REJECTED)
	•	Due Date
	•	Assigned To (Username)
	•	Project ID (dropdown)

✅ Business Rules:
	•	Due date cannot be before today
	•	Task must belong to a project
	•	Only creator can edit task (except Admin)

⸻

5️⃣ Task Approval Module (Admin Only)

Workflow:
	1.	User creates a task → Status = NEW
	2.	Admin reviews task:
	•	Approve → Status = APPROVED
	•	Reject → Status = REJECTED
	3.	User can update task only if status ≠ APPROVED

✅ Admin should see:
	•	List of all tasks
	•	Approve / Reject buttons

⸻

6️⃣ Task Tracking Module

Features:
	•	Filter tasks by:
	•	Status
	•	Priority
	•	Project
	•	Search tasks by title

⸻

🔧 Backend Requirements (Spring Boot)

REST APIs

Project APIs
	•	POST /projects → Create project
	•	GET /projects → Get all projects

	•	DELETE /projects/{id} → Delete project

Task APIs
	•	POST /tasks → Create task
	•	GET /tasks → Get all tasks
	•	GET /tasks/user/{username} → Get user tasks
	•	PUT /tasks/{id} → Update task
	•	DELETE /tasks/{id} → Delete task
	•	PUT /tasks/{id}/approve → Approve task
	•	PUT /tasks/{id}/reject → Reject task

⸻

🗄️ Database Design

User Table
	•	id
	•	username
	•	password
	•	role

Project Table
	•	id
