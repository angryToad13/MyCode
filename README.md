Here’s a 15-day structured task plan for your Inventory Management System project using Spring Boot (backend) and Angular (frontend) with three roles:
	•	User (register vehicles for transporting goods)
	•	Admin (manage warehouse categories & view analytics)
	•	Logistics Coordinator (monitor vehicle movement & goods quality)

⸻

Day 1-2: Project Setup & Planning
	•	Set up Spring Boot project with necessary dependencies (Spring Security, JPA, Hibernate, JWT, etc.).
	•	Set up Angular project with routing and basic UI structure.
	•	Define user roles and authentication flow.
	•	Set up database schema (MySQL/PostgreSQL).

⸻

Day 3-4: Authentication & Authorization
	•	Implement JWT-based authentication in Spring Boot.
	•	Create login, registration, and role-based access in Angular.
	•	Implement guards and interceptors in Angular.

⸻

Day 5-6: User Role - Vehicle Registration
	•	Backend: Create APIs for vehicle registration and listing vehicles.
	•	Frontend: Develop forms for users to register vehicles and view their own registered vehicles.
	•	Save vehicle details in the database.

⸻

Day 7-8: Admin Role - Category Management
	•	Backend: Implement CRUD APIs for categories (e.g., Electronics, Food, etc.).
	•	Frontend: Develop a dashboard for Admin to create, edit, delete, and list categories.
	•	Add validation checks and alerts.

⸻

Day 9-10: Logistics Coordinator - Vehicle Monitoring & Quality Check
	•	Backend:
	•	Implement an API to update vehicle location periodically.
	•	Implement an API for goods quality check (status update, issue reporting).
	•	Frontend:
	•	Display real-time vehicle movement data.
	•	Allow logistics coordinators to mark goods as “Quality Approved” or “Defective”.

⸻

Day 11-12: Admin Role - Analytics Dashboard
	•	Backend: Implement APIs for fetching analytics data:
	•	Total goods in warehouse
	•	Number of active vehicles
	•	Defective vs. approved goods percentage
	•	Frontend: Display analytics using charts and tables.

⸻

Day 13-14: Testing & Bug Fixing
	•	Perform unit tests and integration tests in Spring Boot.
	•	Conduct UI testing and fix bugs in Angular.

⸻

Day 15: Deployment & Documentation
	•	Deploy backend to Spring Boot server (e.g., AWS, Heroku, or local Tomcat).
	•	Deploy frontend using Firebase, Vercel, or Netlify.
	•	Write API documentation (Swagger).
	•	Final testing and project submission.
